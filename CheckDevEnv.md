Check the development environment
=================================
This initial application has just the purpose to check that the 
development environment is up and running. 

To check that everything works do the following:

    npm install
    npm run dev-server
    
The system default web browser shall open a tab on http://localhost:12380/.

On the page you will should the text _It works!_ . 

In addition an alert that says _Yes typescript compilation works as well!_, 
should pop up.

If you see all this everything is working as expected and you are good 
to go for the subsequent labs.
